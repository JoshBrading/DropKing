## Introduction

Drop King is a game about falling. Players will be challenged to reach the bottom of each level as fast as possible while navigating through a minimalist environment, avoiding obstacles, and making split-second decisions. With intuitive controls for jumping and moving, every fall is a test of skill and strategy. Collect keys and gems to unlock shortcuts and boost your score.

## Features

- Intuitive controls for jumping and adjusting horizontal velocity while falling.
- Collectibles such as keys, gems, and hearts to unlock shortcuts, boost score, and increase lives.
- Early exits that require collecting keys and taking risks to access.
